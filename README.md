# üìä SQL Data Warehouse (DWH) Project üìà

This repository showcases a comprehensive SQL Data Warehouse (DWH) project, focusing on data analytics principles from exploratory data analysis (EDA) to advanced analytics. The project aims to demonstrate robust data handling, transformation, and insightful reporting capabilities using SQL.

## ‚ú® Project Overview

This project is structured to cover various aspects of data analytics, as visualized in the project roadmap:

The roadmap outlines a systematic approach to data analysis, encompassing:

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

1.  **Database Exploration:** Understanding the schema and initial data structure.
2.  **Dimensions Exploration:** Analyzing categorical data and their unique values.
3.  **Date Exploration:** Investigating temporal trends and patterns within the data.
4.  **Measures Exploration:** Examining key numerical metrics and their distributions.
5.  **Magnitude:** Understanding the scale and impact of various data points.
6.  **Ranking:** Identifying top N or bottom N entities based on specific criteria.

### Advanced Analytics

7.  **Change-Over-Time Trends:** Analyzing how data evolves over different periods.
8.  **Cumulative Analysis:** Calculating running totals and cumulative sums.
9.  **Performance Analysis:** Evaluating efficiency and effectiveness of processes or entities.
10. **Part-to-Whole (Proportional):** Understanding the contribution of individual parts to a total.
11. **Data Segmentation:** Dividing data into meaningful groups for targeted analysis.
12. **Reporting:** Presenting findings through structured reports and dashboards.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

-   `EDA/`: Contains scripts and queries related to Exploratory Data Analysis.
-   `datasets/`: Stores the raw or processed datasets used in the project.
-   `docs/`: Houses documentation, design documents, or additional notes.
-   `scripts/`: Includes SQL scripts for DWH creation, ETL processes, and advanced queries.
-   `ProjectRoadmap.png`: Visual representation of the project's analytical phases.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

-   **T-SQL:** The primary language used for database interactions, DWH creation, and data manipulation.
